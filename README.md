What Would Beyoncé Do?
======================

A Flawless Hacks 2019 project, inspired by the late great website Please Help Me Beyoncé ([pleasehelpmebeyonce.com](http://pleasehelpmebeyonce.com)). 
and its [reborn incarnation](http://www.pleasehelpmebeyonce.annaro.se/).

Python backend using the Spotify API; vanilla JS on the frontend (with jQuery for $.ajax(), none of us have time to learn the Fetch API right now)
